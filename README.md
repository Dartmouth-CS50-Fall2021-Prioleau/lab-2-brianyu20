This is the initial readme.md file of my lab2 submission.

I mistakenly forgot to comment in the purpose of the testing.sh in chill. Because the lab instructions are precautions of 
pushing files when we're done with the section and have already moved onto the next section, I'm putting the purpose here:

#purpose: testing chill.c, both with normal cases and existing cases.
